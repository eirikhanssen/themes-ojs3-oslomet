# themes-ojs3-oslomet

## Theme hierarchy
1. The base theme for hosted journals will be called 'universell' theme, which will be child of, and inherit from the "default" ojs3-theme
   - Changes made here, will be applied for all hosted journals
2. Each journal will get their own theme that will be child of "universell" theme
   - Changes made here will apply only for that journal
